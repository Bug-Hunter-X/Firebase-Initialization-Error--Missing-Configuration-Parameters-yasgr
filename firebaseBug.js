The Firebase SDK might throw an error if the provided configuration object is incorrect or missing required fields. This often occurs when initializing the Firebase app.  For example, forgetting to include the `apiKey`, `authDomain`, or `projectId` in your `firebaseConfig` object will result in an initialization error.
